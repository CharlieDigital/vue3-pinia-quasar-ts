# Vue 3 + Typescript + Vite

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 and Typescript in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

## Included Libraries

- [Quasar](https://quasar.dev/).  Quasar is a powerful set of components which uses the Material UI design system.  While the styles are quite plain on their own (and perhaps even off-putting), it is easy to customize it.  I have used it extensively for my own projects like [Turas.app](https://turas.app), [Turas.app Chrome Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/turasapp/lpfijfdbgohlblnadiokliolkkeeblpo), [Zeeq.ai](https://zeeq.ai), and [CodeRev.app](https://coderev.app).  It is easy and fast; great for internal tooling and more than usable for public facing apps.
- [Pinia]([https://](https://pinia.vuejs.org/introduction.html)).  Pinia is state management for Vue.  While it's not strictly necessary to use Pinia, it provides good integration with the devtools and hot module replacement for global state.  It makes it easy to manage state that is truly global!
