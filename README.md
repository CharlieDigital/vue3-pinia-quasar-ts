# Vue3, Vite, Pinia (Vuex 5), Vue Router 4, Quasar, TypeScript Starter Template

This repo contains a starter template that connects the following pieces:

- [Vue3](https://v3.vuejs.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Pinia (de facto Vuex 5)](https://pinia.vuejs.org/)
- [Vue Router 4](https://next.router.vuejs.org/guide/)
- [Quasar](https://quasar.dev/)

## Rationale

This is inspired by [Evan You's presentation at VueConf Toronto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KBHvaAWJOA) on the future state of Vue development.

Having worked in Vue and React, one thing that is clear is that the Vue community reflects the fact there is a bit more of what Fred Brookes terms "conceptual integrity" because of the nature of how the ecosystem is being designed and architected as a community with a clear direction and leadership.

In the Vue ecosystem, there are a clear set of "best practices" which are coalescing around key building blocks which simplifies the overall architecture and, in my opinion, enhances productivity.

## Usage

```
cd web
yarn run dev
```

See the [Vite template README](web/README.md) for more details and notes.
